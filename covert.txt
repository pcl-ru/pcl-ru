Original text:

Dear Reader,

Practical Common Lisp ... isn't that an oxymoron? If you're like most programmers, you
probably know something about Lisp—from a comp sci course in college or from learning
enough Elisp to customize Emacs a bit. Or maybe you just know someone who won't shut up
about Lisp, the greatest language ever. But you probably never figured you'd see practical
and Lisp in the same book title.

Yet, you're reading this; you must want to know more. Maybe you believe learning Lisp will
make you a better programmer in any language. Or maybe you just want to know what those
Lisp fanatics are yammering about all the time. Or maybe you have learned some Lisp but
haven't quite made the leap to using it to write interesting software.

If any of those is true, this book is for you. Using Common Lisp, an ANSI standardized,
industrial-strength dialect of Lisp, I show you how to write software that goes well
beyond silly academic exercises or trivial editor customizations. And I show you how
Lisp—even with many of its features adopted by other languages—still has a few tricks up
its sleeve.

But unlike many Lisp books, this one doesn't just touch on a few of Lisp's greatest
features and then leave you on your own to actually use them. I cover all the language
features you'll need to write real programs and devote well over a third of the book to
developing nontrivial software—a statistical spam filter, a library for parsing binary
files, and a server for streaming MP3s over a network complete with an online MP3 database
and Web interface.

So turn the book over, open it up, and see for yourself how eminently practical using the
greatest language ever invented can be.

Sincerely, Peter Seibel
